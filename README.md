# IL Population Prediction
Population prediction based on historical data given for Illinois and its various cities. Historical data was from 1991 to 2009. Done as a side project by me to show interest in data science.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Running the Program
This project runs all code on a Python notebook to easily visualize the data. You can install it by typing in:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install jupyter
```
into your terminal. Once that is install, simple type in
```bash
jupyter-notebook Predict.ipynb
```
to launch the notebook.

Most likely, it will open at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
